# ES.NEXT Code Snippets and Challenges
> The code snippets in each directory correspond to the lecture material of the same name.

## Important Note

Except where noted, each example is intended to highlight **ONLY ONE** ES.NEXT feature at a time. In other words, the examples are written primarily in ES9, with *ONLY ONE* part of the syntax upgraded to ES.NEXT for each example. This is deliberate, so the lectures in this section can be watched in any order (and do not build on each other except where noted).

When you're rewriting the examples on your own (or completing the homeworks), you are welcome to upgrade all (or part) of the syntax to ES.NEXT based on your current comfort-level and the order in which you've been watching the lectures.
